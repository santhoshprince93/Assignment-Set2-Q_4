4.	Let X ~ N(100, 202). Find two values, a and b, symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of the random variable taking a value between them is 0.99. 

A.	90.5, 105.9 
B.	80.2, 119.8 
C.	22, 78 
D.	48.5, 151.5 
E.	90.1, 109.9
Ans: Since we need to find out the values of a and b, which are symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of random variable taking a value between them is 0.99, we have to work out in reverse order. The Probability of getting value between a and b should be 0.99. So the Probability of going wrong, or the Probability outside the a and b area is 0.01 (ie. 1-0.99).The Probability towards left from a = -0.005 (ie. 0.01/2). The Probability towards right from b = +0.005 (ie. 0.01/2).So since we have the probabilities of a and b, we need to calculate X, the random variable at a and b which has got these probabilities. By finding the Standard Normal Variable Z (Z Value), we can calculate the X values.Z=(X-μ) / σ For Probability 0.005 the Z Value is -2.57 (from Z Table).Z * σ + μ = XZ(-0.005)*20+100 = -(-2.57)*20+100 = 151.4Z(+0.005)*20+100 = (-2.57)*20+100 = 48.6So, option D is correct.
